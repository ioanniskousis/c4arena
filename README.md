## About  
The project was assigned to me as a challenge during an interview process, to build it in 1.5 hours and I built the first approach in 2 hours, and completed the final approach in 3 hours.

It is played by 2 players.  
Each player drops balls on a column of their choise trying to setup structures of at least 4 balls in a row, column, or diagonal.

Messages are shown at the top-bar on edge cases and palyers are swapt on game over.

## Technologies used

- HTML5 was used to setup the basic interface skeleton with minimum containers.
- Javascript (ES6) was used to create all the active alements on the load of the page and manage the game logic.
- CSS3 styled the elements
- SVG was used to mark the winning lines
